|| Anatomy of HTML
- self-closing tags or tags with start and end tags 
- HTML attributes for modifications 
- web.archive.org (Internet Archive Wayback Machine) shows how websites looked before 


|| The HTML Boilerplate 
- <!DOCTYPE html> specifies the version of HTML
- Mojibake is the garbled, messed up text that results from decoding text with the unintended character encoding 
- description meta tag is what is shown by browser searches 
- browser crawl the HTML document and look for certain meta tags 

|| Unicode and Character Sets, Minimum Info
- Unicode creates a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet 
- In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point which is a theoretical concept 
- Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consorium (e.g. U+0639)
    - U means Unicode 
    - The number is in hexadecimal 
- a little ? character shows up if the Unicode character we are trying to decode does not have a corresponding representation in the target 
character encoding 


|| Image Tag 
- When we include an external URL, the browser has to ping the server that hosts the image to try to obtain the image 



|| HTML Tags 
- <em></em> for italization instead of <i></i>
- <strong></strong> for bolding 

|| Form Element
