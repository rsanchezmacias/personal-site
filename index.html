                            My first job out of college (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜) ! I returned to Verizon a month after
                            graduating. I moved to Georgia around June, and I
                            have been working remotely and in the office since then. I was lucky to go through a
                            rotation program (iOS mobile development, automation testing,
                            and DevOps) and learn from many technologies. I learned that, in tech, the only thing
                            constant is change.

                            For the summer of 2020, I was given the opportunity to return back to Verizon Connect. I was
                            working remotely from California
                            since the pandemic made it impossible for us to work on-site in Georgia. Although I didn't
                            get to see the beluga whale again like in 2019, I got
                            to work with some amazing people doing iOS development.

                            registration closed. While attending the conference, I applied to Verizon and interviewed

                            UC Merced. I landed my first internship and my first job as a software developer! Not only

                            to meet some great,inded friends over the summer and explore Atlanta.
